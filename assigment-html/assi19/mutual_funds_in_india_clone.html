    <h5 id="2">2020 Franklin Templeton Mutual Fund fiasco <span>[edit]</span></h5>
    <p>In April 2020,<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franklin_Templeton_Investments">Franklin Templeton</a> India
        unexpectedly wound up six credit funds with assets of close
        to $4 billion, citing a lack of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquidity_crisis">liquidity</a> amid the
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic">coronavirus pandemic</a> . These funds
        had large exposure to higher-yielding, lower-rated credit securities. The <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Securities_and_Exchange_Board_of_India">Securities and Exchange Board of
            India</a> (SEBI) conducted a probe into this sudden closure and found “serious lapses and violations”. As
        a result, in June 2021, SEBI barred Franklin Templeton Mutual Fund from launching any new debt schemes for two
        years. The regulator also ordered the fund house to refund investment and advisory fees, along with interest, of
        more than 5 billion rupees, and fined the global giant another 50 million rupees.
        <span><sup>[15][16][17][18]</sup></span>
    </p>
    <p>Franklin Templeton said it strongly disagreed with the SEBI’s order and planned to appeal against it. The
        decision to wind up the schemes “was taken with the sole objective of preserving value for unitholders”, a
        spokesperson said. However, the closure of these funds sparked panic withdrawals from other Franklin Templeton
        schemes as well as credit funds of other asset managers, leading to a storm on social media and court cases by
        distraught investors. <span><sup>[18][15][17]</sup></span></p>

    <h5 id="3">Reliance Mutual Fund <span>[edit]</span></h5>
    <p>In 2019, the debt schemes of Reliance Mutual Fund faced a liquidity crisis due to their exposure to troubled
        companies like Dewan Housing Finance Corporation (DHFL). This led to severe redemptions and forced asset sales,
        which significantly affected investors. <span><sup>[19][20]</sup></span></p>

    <h5 id="4">IL&FS crisis and impact <span>[edit]</span></h5>
    <p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure_Leasing_%26_Financial_Services">IL&FS</a> crisis in
        2018 had a significant impact on the mutual fund industry, including those
        managed by IDBI Mutual Fund. The defaults by IL&FS led to a series of downgrades and defaults on its debt
        obligations and inter-corporate deposits1. This situation caused considerable distress in the financial markets
        and led to significant markdowns in the Net Asset Values (NAVs) of the affected mutual fund schemes, resulting
        in losses to investors. <span>[21][22][23]</span></p>
    <p>The defaults by Infrastructure Leasing & Financial Services (IL&FS) triggered a liquidity crisis, making it
        difficult for mutual funds to meet redemption demands without selling assets at distressed prices. This event
        heightened concerns about credit risk, leading to widespread downgrades of IL&FS and other non-banking financial
        companies (NBFCs). Consequently, the net asset values (NAVs) of mutual funds holding these securities were
        adversely affected, reflecting the increased credit risk and decreased market confidence.
        <span>[24][25][26][27]</span>
    </p>
    <p>Investor confidence in debt mutual funds, particularly those with high exposure to NBFCs and infrastructure debt,
        was severely undermined. This led to significant outflows as investors moved towards safer and more liquid
        investment options. In response, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) introduced stricter
        regulations on sectoral exposure, single issuer limits, and the quality of collateral accepted in debt funds to
        enhance liquidity and reduce risks. Fund managers began focusing on higher-quality assets and improved risk
        management practices. The crisis underscored the need for better credit assessment and liquidity management,
        prompting regulatory reforms and a more cautious investment approach within the mutual fund industry.
        <span>[24][25][26][27]</span>
    </p>

    <h5 id="5">Amtek Auto Impact <span>[edit]</span></h5>
    <p>Several mutual funds, including those managed by JP Morgan Asset Management India, faced significant issues due
        to exposure to Amtek Auto, which defaulted on its debt in 2015. JP Morgan had to suspend redemptions and impose
        exit loads to manage the liquidity crisis. <span>[28][29][30]</span></p>

    <h5 id="6">Birla Sun Life Mutual Fund (Aditya Birla Sun Life Mutual Fund) <span>[edit]</span></h5>
    <p>In 2018, Aditya Birla Sun Life Mutual Fund faced redemption pressures in some of its debt schemes due to exposure
        to entities like the Essel Group companies. The Economic Times reported that the Aditya Birla Sun Life Mutual
        Fund was the biggest investor in the Essel Group, with an exposure of Rs 2,936 crore spread across 28 schemes1.
        This accounted for almost 37% of the total debt fund exposure to the Zee group, which is part of the <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Essel_Group">Essel Group</a> <span> <sup>[31]</sup></span></p>
    <h5 id="7">Dewan Housing Finance Corporation (DHFL) crisis and impact <span>[edit]</span></h5>
    <p>The Dewan Housing Finance Corporation (DHFL) crisis had a profound impact on the Indian mutual fund industry.
        DHFL's defaults created a severe liquidity crunch, making it difficult for mutual funds to meet redemption
        pressures without selling assets at heavily discounted prices. This crisis raised significant concerns about the
        creditworthiness of housing finance companies (HFCs) and non-banking financial companies (NBFCs), leading to
        downgrades of DHFL's debt instruments and adversely affecting the net asset values (NAVs) of mutual funds
        holding these securities. <span><sup>[32][33][34][35]</sup></span></p>
    <p>Investor confidence in debt mutual funds, especially those with high exposure to HFCs and NBFCs, was severely
        shaken, resulting in substantial outflows as investors sought safer investments. In response, the Securities and
        Exchange Board of India (SEBI) increased scrutiny and introduced tighter regulations on mutual funds' exposure
        to individual issuers and sectors to mitigate such risks in the future. Fund managers adjusted their portfolios
        by shifting towards higher-quality and more liquid assets, reducing exposure to high-risk debt instruments. The
        crisis underscored the importance of credit quality and liquidity management, prompting regulatory reforms and a
        more cautious approach within the mutual fund industry.<span><sup>[32][33][34][35]</sup></span></p>

    <h5 id="8">2001 UTI Mutual Fund (Unit Trust of India) fiasco <span>[edit]</span></h5>
    <p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTI_Asset_Management">The Unit Trust of India</a> (UTI) faced a
        significant crisis in 2001, which was primarily due to
        large-scale redemption pressures and mismanagement, particularly in its flagship scheme, US-6412. The crisis was
        exacerbated by the Ketan Parekh scam, which caused a sharp decline in stock prices, leading to mutual funds,
        including UTI’s schemes, suffering severe consequences. <span><sup>[36][37][38]</sup></span></p>
    <p>The government intervened to protect investors and restructured UTI. This restructuring led to the bifurcation of
        UTI into two separate entities in 2003: the UTI Mutual Fund (now managed by the UTI Trustee Company Pvt. Ltd.)
        and the Specified Undertaking of the Unit Trust of India (SUUTI), which took over the assets and liabilities of
        the erstwhile UTI12. The government’s intervention included a bailout package to stabilize the situation and
        ensure the protection of investors’ interests.<span><sup>[32][33][34][35]</sup></span></p>

    <h5 id="9">DHFL Pramerica Mutual Fund <span>[edit]</span></h5>
    <p>Dewan Housing Finance Corporation Limited (DHFL) defaulted on its debt obligations in 2019. This event led to
        significant governance concerns and defaults by DHFL in meeting various payment obligations, prompting the
        Reserve Bank of India to supersede the Board of Directors of DHFL1. The default affected several mutual funds,
        including those managed by BNP Paribas Asset Management India Private Limited, which had to mark down the value
        of their investments in DHFL’s securities. <span>[39][40][32][35]</span></p>
    <p>The crisis deepened with rating downgrades and write-offs by mutual funds, which had a cumulative exposure of
        ₹5,336 crore to securities issued by DHFL3. As a result, there was a severe liquidity issue and a drop in the
        Net Asset Values (NAVs) of the mutual funds, impacting investors’ returns. DHFL Pramerica Mutual Fund, which was
        a joint venture between DHFL and Pramerica Financial, Inc., also faced challenges due to the exposure to DHFL’s
        debt instruments.<span>[39][40][32][35]</span></p>

    <h5 id="10">Yes Mutual Fund<span>[edit]</span></h5>
    <p>In 2019, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yes_Bank">Yes Bank</a> faced severe financial stress and was
        eventually placed under a moratorium by the
        Reserve Bank of India (RBI) in March 2020. This led to significant challenges for Yes Mutual Fund, particularly
        its debt schemes that had exposure to Yes Bank’s securities. The crisis necessitated write-downs and affected
        investor confidence. Around 32 mutual fund schemes had exposure to Yes Bank’s downgraded debt papers, with a
        total exposure amounting to approximately ₹2,848 crore. The crisis led to write-downs of these securities and
        impacted the net asset values (NAVs) of the mutual funds involved, which in turn affected investor confidence.
        <span>[41][42][43]</span>
    </p>

    <h5 id="11">Kotak Mutual Fund <span>[edit]</span></h5>
    <p>In 2019, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kotak_Mutual_Fund">Kotak Mutual Fund</a> did face challenges with
        its Fixed Maturity Plans (FMPs) due to exposure
        to debt securities of companies like the Essel Group. The fund house was unable to redeem investments from these
        companies, which led to delays and partial rollovers of the FMPs. This situation affected the investors’
        expected returns. Consequently, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) barred Kotak from launching
        new FMPs for six months and imposed a fine for failing to abide by regulatory requirements.
        <span><sup>[44]</sup></span>
    </p>

    <h5 id="12">HDFC Mutual Fund <span>[edit]</span></h5>
    <p>HDFC Mutual Fund did face a situation in 2018-2019 due to its exposure to companies like <span>Essel Group</span>
        and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure_Leasing_%26_Financial_Services">IL&FS</a>. The credit
        events involving these companies led to significant mark-downs in the <span style="color: rgb(160, 37, 37);">Net
            Asset Values</span> (NAVs) of some of HDFC Mutual Fund’s debt schemes.
        This situation resulted in investor concerns and redemption pressures. <span><sup>[45][46]</sup></span></p>
    <h5 id="13">Sahara Mutual Fund <span>[edit]</span></h5>
    <p>SEBI conducted an examination to determine whether Sahara Mutual Fund, its Asset Management Company, and its
        trustees were ‘fit and proper’ as per regulatory standards. This was in light of a previous SEBI order from 2011
        concerning two other Sahara entities, which were directed to refund money collected through Optionally Fully
        Convertible Debentures (OFCDs) to investors. <span><sup>[47][48]</sup></span></p>
    <p>In 2015, SEBI ordered the winding up of Sahara Mutual Fund’s schemes due to non-compliance with regulatory
        requirements. The regulatory scrutiny and legal challenges indeed led to operational difficulties and affected
        investor confidence in the fund house. <span><sup>[49][50]</sup></span></p>

    <h3>Market segment <span>[edit]</span></h3>
    <hr>
    <p>Despite being available in the market,<span><sup>[51]</sup></span> a recent report on Mutual Fund Investments in
        India published by research and analytics firm, Boston Analytics, suggests <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Investor">investors</a> are holding
        back from putting their money into mutual funds due to their perceived high risk and a lack of information on
        how mutual funds work. <span><sup>[52] </sup></span>There are 46 Mutual Funds as of June 2013. <span><sup>[53]
            </sup></span>In 2019, Asset under management (AUM) of the mutual fund industry rose by 13% to 24 trillion in
