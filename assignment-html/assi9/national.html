<h3> Article 1 : New Education Policy Announced</h3>
<p>The <b>New Education Policy (NEP)</b> aims to transform the Indian education system by focusing on flexibility, skill development, and holistic learning. It replaces the old 10+2 structure with <b> 5+3+3+4</b> model, covering foundational, preparatory, middle, and secondary stages. The policy emphasizes teaching in the mother tongue or regional language till at least Class 5, introduces vocational education and coding from Class 6, and promotes experiential learning instead of rote memorization. In higher education, it brings in a <b>multidisciplinary approach, a four-year undergraduate program with multiple exit and entry options, and a credit transfer system</b></p>
<h3>Article 2 : Floods in Assam</h3>
<p>The state of Assam faces devastating floods almost every year, and in 2025 the situation has been especially severe. Heavy monsoon rains, along with overflowing rivers like the Brahmaputra and its tributaries, have submerged vast areas of land across several districts. As a result, lakhs of people have been displaced, many are living in relief camps, and normal life has been disrupted with damage to homes, roads, and crops. Tragically, the floods have also claimed many lives and caused landslides in hilly regions. Wildlife sanctuaries such as Kaziranga and Pobitora have been badly affected, forcing animals to move to higher ground and resulting in loss of biodiversity. Although government and disaster relief teams are working to provide shelter, food, and rescue operations, embankment breaches and continuous rainfall remain major challenges. The floods in Assam highlight the state’s vulnerability to natural disasters and the urgent need for long-term solutions like stronger flood management systems, riverbank protection, and sustainable planning.</p>

<p>ChatGPT said:

The newly opened <b>Yellow Line of Bengaluru’s Namma Metro</b> is a 19.15-kilometre elevated corridor stretching from RV Road in the north to Bommasandra in the south-east, covering 16 stations. Inaugurated on <b>10 August 2025</b> at a cost of around ₹7,600 crore, the line connects key areas like BTM Layout, Jayadeva Hospital, Central Silk Board, Bommanahalli, and Electronics City, offering much-needed relief to daily commuters. With operating hours from 5:00 AM to 11:00 PM and fares ranging from ₹10 to ₹90, the Yellow Line has already witnessed a strong response, carrying over 52,000 passengers on its first day and boosting overall metro ridership to over 10 lakh. Initially running with limited trains every 25 minutes, services will gradually be expanded to meet the projected demand of nearly 8 lakh daily users. By linking residential zones with IT and industrial hubs, this metro line is expected to significantly cut travel time, reduce road congestion, and improve connectivity across Bengaluru.</p>
