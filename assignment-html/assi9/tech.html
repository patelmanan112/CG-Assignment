    <h3>Article 1 :  AI Advancements in 2025 </h3>
    <p>

In 2025, artificial intelligence has advanced rapidly across multiple fields. In robotics, humanoid robots like Apptronik’s Apollo are being deployed for tasks in warehouses, healthcare, and elder care, while OpenAI is working on physical intelligence for real-world applications. In science and healthcare, AI systems such as DeepMind’s models are cutting drug discovery times from years to months, and tools like DeepSeek are assisting doctors in diagnostics and treatment planning. On the infrastructure side, Nvidia launched powerful new chips like “Blackwell Ultra,” while the UK introduced the Isambard-AI supercomputer to support research in medicine, climate, and public safety. AI is also becoming multimodal, capable of handling text, images, audio, and video together, and new agents like Manus AI can reason and perform complex tasks autonomously. Alongside these breakthroughs, governments and researchers are focusing on AI safety, transparency, and regulation to ensure ethical and responsible use. Together, these developments show that AI in 2025 is not only more powerful but also more practical, shaping industries and daily life.</p>
<h3>Article 2 : SpaceX Launch</h3>
<p>On September 14, 2025, SpaceX successfully launched the <b> Cygnus XL</b> spacecraft atop a Falcon 9 rocket from Cape Canaveral to the International Space Station (ISS). This mission, NG‑23, is Northrop Grumman’s 23rd resupply flight under NASA’s Commercial Resupply Services‑2 contract. The upgraded Cygnus XL can carry about <b>33% more cargo</b> than earlier versions, delivering roughly   <b>11,000 pounds </b> of supplies, including food, scientific experiments, spare parts, and materials for research. The Falcon 9 first-stage booster, flying for the fourth time, safely landed back at Cape Canaveral after separation. Cygnus XL is scheduled to be captured and berthed to the ISS by the robotic arm, Canadarm2, on September 17. This mission enhances the ISS’s resupply capacity, supports ongoing research, and ensures astronauts have the materials they need for daily operations and experiments.</p>
